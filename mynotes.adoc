== Integrity with Hashing 

== Key Derivation functions (Password Hashing)

Key derivation (also known as password hashing) is the process of taking a user-provided password and transforming it into a secure, cryptographically derived key or hash. This is commonly used in authentication systems to store passwords securely and prevent unauthorized access.

Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) like Argon2, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are designed primarily to protect against offline brute-force attacks, where an attacker has access to stolen password hashes.

.Why Use Key Derivation?
1. Security Against Brute Force Attacks: Instead of storing raw passwords, a derived key is stored, making it computationally difficult for attackers to retrieve the original password.
2. Mitigating Rainbow Table Attacks: A good key derivation function (KDF) includes salts (random values) to ensure that even identical passwords do not produce the same hash.
3. Adjustable Computational Cost: Many KDFs allow for tunable parameters that control execution time and memory use to remain resilient against evolving hardware capabilities.

Popular Key Derivation Functions
• PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
• Argon2 (Winner of the Password Hashing Competition)
• bcrypt
• scrypt


.What distinguishes Key Derivation (Password Hashing) from using traditional hash functions (e.g., Sha2, MD5, etc) to hide passwords?

Many people assume that hashing a password with a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256 or MD5) is enough to store passwords securely, but this is a major security mistake. Key Derivation functions (Password Hashing) are designed specifically for securing passwords, whereas general-purpose hash functions are not. 

Factors that distinguish one from the other:

*1. Computational Cost (Work Factor)*
* *Regular Hashing* (SHA-256, MD5, etc.)
** Designed to be fast and efficient for general cryptographic operations (e.g., digital signatures, checksums).
** Since they are fast, an attacker can brute-force billions of password guesses per second.
* *Key Derivation Functions* (PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2, etc.)
** Designed to be _intentionally slow_ to make brute-force attacks infeasible.
** Some allow adjustable time and memory hardness to resist GPU/ASIC attacks (e.g., Argon2).
* *Example*: A GPU can compute SHA-256 hashes at speeds exceeding 10 billion hashes per second, but Argon2 can be configured to take 100ms per hash, drastically slowing down brute-force attempts.
+
*2. Use of Salt (Uniqueness)*
* *Regular Hashing*
** If you hash the same password with SHA-256, it always produces the same hash.
** This makes it vulnerable to *rainbow table attacks* (precomputed hash lookups).
* *Key Derivation Functions*
** Always include a random salt (a unique value per password).
** This ensures that even if two users choose the same password, their stored hashes will be different.
+
*3. Resistance to Brute-Force and Hardware Attacks*
* *Regular Hashing*
** Vulnerable to dictionary attacks (attackers hash common passwords and compare).
** GPUs and ASICs can compute billions of hashes per second.
* *Key Derivation Functions*
** Include features like iterations (PBKDF2) or memory-hardness (Argon2, scrypt) to make brute-force attacks expensive.
** bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 can be configured to require more memory, making parallel attacks infeasible.
+
*Example*: Using SHA-256, an attacker can compute 10 billion hashes/sec on a GPU. Using Argon2, you can force it to take 100ms per attempt, reducing attack speed to just 10 attempts/sec.
+
*4. Adaptive Security*
* *Regular Hashing*
** Hardcoded output (e.g., SHA-256 always produces a 256-bit hash).
** Cannot be adjusted over time.
* *Key Derivation Functions*
** Can increase computational cost as hardware improves.
** bcrypt has a “cost” parameter, and Argon2 allows adjusting memory, iterations, and parallelism.
+
*Example*: In 2025, password hashing may need to be 10× slower than in 2020 due to faster computers. With Argon2, we can increase memory and iteration parameters to keep it secure.


There are three versions of Argon2, each optimized for different security needs:
1. Argon2d (Fastest, but less resistant to side-channel attacks)
 • Uses data-dependent memory access.
 • Optimized for resisting GPU-based attacks (e.g., brute-force).
 • Suitable for cryptocurrency mining but not recommended for password hashing because it’s vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
2. Argon2i 🔒 (More secure, slightly slower)
 • Uses data-independent memory access.
 • Resistant to side-channel attacks but slower than Argon2d.
 • Best for password hashing & key derivation functions.
3. Argon2id ⚡ (Best of both worlds)
 • A hybrid of Argon2d and Argon2i (starts


*Take-away*
- Never use SHA-256, MD5, or other general-purpose hash functions for passwords.
- Use Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 for securely hashing passwords.


== Integrity and Authentication with HMAC 



== Symmetric Encryption: authenticated encryption (confidenciality, integrity and authentication)

Symmetric encryption means *using the same key for both encryption and decryption*.

----

The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link.
It is efficient and widely used for securing data in _transit_ and at _rest_. 

However, just encrypting data does not guarantee that it will remain unchanged while encrypted, we also need to ensure its `integrity` and `authenticity`.Hence, often a message authentication code is added to a ciphertext to ensure that changes to the ciphertext will be noted by the receiver. That is where A`uthenticated Encryption with Associated Data` (*AEAD*) comes in.

Two widely used AEAD ciphers are:

- AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois Counter Mode)
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 (a secure, efficient alternative to AES)

=== AES-GCM (AES-256-GCM)

In cryptography, Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a mode of operation for symmetric-key cryptographic block ciphers which is widely adopted for its performance.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a block cipherfootnote:disclaimer[In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm that operates on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks.]  that operates on fixed-size blocks of data (e.g., 128, 192, or 256 bits). GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) turns AES into a stream cipher, making it faster and adding authentication.

=== ChaCha20-Poly1305

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher that is often used as a faster alternative to AES-GCM, especially on systems without hardware acceleration (e.g., mobile and embedded devices).

Key Features:

- Stream cipher: No block size, making it more efficient for variable-length data.
- Resistant to side-channel attacks (unlike AES which is vulnerable to cache-timing attacks).
- Poly1305: A fast MAC function ensures integrity.
- Nonce (IV) should be unique, just like AES-GCM.


=== Takeaway:
- `AES` (Basic AES in ECB, CBC, or CTR modes) provides confidentiality only but does not ensure integrity or authenticity.
 - `AES-256-GCM` provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity due to its GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which includes authentication via GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code).
- `ChaCha20-Poly1305` also provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, using ChaCha20 for encryption and Poly1305 for authentication, similar to how AES-GCM operates.
- Both `AES-256-GCM` and `ChaCha20-Poly1305` are *AEAD* (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) ciphers, meaning they prevent tampering and ensure message authenticity in addition to encryption.

== Asymmetric Encryption: 

Asymmetric cryptography (or public-key cryptography) is a cryptographic system that uses key pairs:

- A public key for encryption (or signature verification).
- A private key for decryption (or signing).

RustCrypto is a collection of cryptographic libraries in Rust that provide secure and efficient implementations of cryptographic algorithms.

=== Asymmetric Cryptography Basics

Asymmetric encryption is used in protocols like TLS, PGP, and SSH. 
The main properties of asymmetric cryptography are:

- Confidentiality: A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
- Authentication : A signature created with the private key can be verified with the public key.
- Non-repudiation: A digital signature ensures the sender cannot deny sending the message.

*The most common asymmetric encryption algorithms include:*

- *RSA* (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) : for encryption/decryption, but avoid unless compatibility is required, as it's slower.
- *ECC* (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): for key agreement, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks
- *Diffie-Hellman* (for key exchange)
- *ECDSA*: avoid, more error-prone than Ed25519
- *X25519* (for Diffie-Hellman key exchange ): *Recommended*, secure alternative to ECDH.
- *Ed25519* (for digital signatures) → *Recommended*, fast and secure.

*What is Padding scheme?*

A padding scheme in RSA encryption is a method used to securely format plaintext before encryption, ensuring that the message is of the correct length and adding randomness to prevent certain types of attacks.

Why is Padding Necessary?

- RSA encryption is deterministic (same input → same output), making it vulnerable to replay attacks.
- Without padding, small messages (e.g., “yes” or “no”) could be easily guessed.
- Padding adds randomness, making it harder for attackers to infer the original message.

Common RSA Padding Schemes:

* *PKCS#1* v1.5 Padding
** One of the earliest padding schemes.
** Adds a fixed structure with random bytes to the message before encryption.
** Vulnerable to padding oracle attacks like Bleichenbacher’s attack.
* *OAEP* (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)
** A more secure padding scheme introduced in PKCS#1 v2.0.
** Uses a mask generation function (MGF) (often MGF1 with SHA-256).
** Adds randomness to resist chosen ciphertext attacks.
* *PSS* (Probabilistic Signature Scheme)
** Used for RSA signatures (not encryption).
** Introduced in PKCS#1 v2.1.
** More secure than PKCS#1 v1.5 for signing.

More about OAEP: 

Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) is a padding scheme used in RSA encryption to prevent vulnerabilities such as dictionary attacks and chosen-ciphertext attacks. OAEP introduces randomness and ensures that encrypting the same plaintext twice produces different ciphertexts.

The OAEP scheme follows these steps:

- Uses a hash function (e.g., SHA-256) for security.
- Introduces randomness via a mask generation function (MGF1).
- Prevents an attacker from deducing plaintext structure.

===  Digital Signatures and verification with RustCrypto

In the RustCrypto ecosystem, we have multiple digital signature algorithms like RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA (Ed25519). 
For signing & verification in the RustCrypto ecosystem, the recommended libraries are:


=== Key exchange 

In cryptography, key exchange is essential for establishing secure communication between parties. RustCrypto provides crates to facilitate secure key exchange implementations in Rust.
The main approaches include:
1. Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange: uses modular arithmetic and large prime numbers for secure key generation.
2. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH): a more efficient method using elliptic curve cryptography.
3. X25519: an instance of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange algorithm, optimized for efficient and security


==== DH key exchange 

1. Both parties agree on a prime number `p` and generator `g`.
2. Each generates a private key (`a` and `b`).
3. Public keys are computed as `A = g^a mod p` and `B = g^b mod p`.
4. Each party computes the shared secret, ensuring `B^a mod p` == `A^b mod p`.

==== ECDH : Elliptic curve Diffie-Helmman 

1. Alice and Bob generate random `ephemeral` secrets (`private` keys).
2. They derive `public` keys from these secrets.
3. Each party uses the other’s public key to compute a `shared secret`.
4. The derived secrets match, enabling secure communication.

==== X25519 : 

1. Both parties generate private keys (StaticSecret).
2. Public keys are derived from private keys.
3. Each computes a shared secret using the other’s public key.
4. Shared secrets match, enabling encrypted communication.

== Final notes

- Use SHA-256 or BLAKE3 for hashing.
- Use HMAC-SHA-256 for authentication.
- Use AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption.
- Use Ed25519 for signatures, X25519 for key exchange.
- Use Argon2 for password hashing.
- Use rand/getrandom for secure random numbers.
