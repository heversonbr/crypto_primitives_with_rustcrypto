# Cryptography  Primitives with RustCrypto - Short Tutorial

## Introduction

Cryptography is essential for securing data, ensuring integrity, and protecting communications. In this tutorial, we will explore basic cryptographic primitives using RustCrypto. 
RustCrypto is a collection of cryptographic libraries written in the Rust programming language. It provides secure and efficient cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and tools for developers. The libraries within RustCrypto cover various cryptographic primitives such as hashing (e.g., SHA-256), encryption (e.g., AES), digital signatures, key exchange, etc.
In this tutorial will present practical examples of how to use some of these primitives.


## 1) Hash with SHA-256

Hashing is a one-way function that takes an input and produces a fixed-length output (hash). It is commonly used for checksums, password storage, and data integrity verification.
In summary:

- A hashing algorithm (SHA-256 in this case) takes an input and computes a unique hash.
- Even a small change in the input drastically changes the hash (avalanche effect).
- Hashes are deterministic: the same input always results in the same hash.
- Hashing is useful for verifying file integrity, password storage (with additional salting), digital signatures

## 2) Key Derivation Functions and Password Hashing

Key Derivation Functions (KDF) enhance password security by making brute-force attacks computationally expensive. Unlike simple hashing, KDFs introduce time and memory costs.

### Differences Between SHA-256 and Argon2:

----
| Feature                | SHA-256 |          Argon2 
|------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| Speed                  | Fast           | Slow (intentionally)     |
| Salted?                | No             | Yes                      |
| Brute-force Resistant? | No             | Yes                      |
| Use case               | General hashing | Password hashing |

## 3) Message Authentication Using HMAC

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) ensures both the integrity and authenticity of a message using a shared secret key.

In order to do that, both sender and receiver must know a secret shared key. The sender generates an `HMAC` for a message using this shared key and transmits both the message and the HMAC to the receiver. Upon receiving the data, the receiver recalculates the `HMAC` using the same secret shared key and checks whether it matches the received `HMAC`. This process ensures both message integrity and authenticity. 

link:src/message_authentication.rs[This example] shows how we can use RustCrypto to generate and verify a `HMAC`.
