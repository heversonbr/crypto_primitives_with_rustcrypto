== Introduction

Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing data, ensuring integrity, and protecting communications. In this short tutorial, we explore fundamental cryptographic primitives using the RustCrypto. RustCrypto is a collection of pure Rust libraries designed for flexibility, safety, and performance.

Before diving in, it is important to choose the right cryptographic library based on your specific needs. Here is a brief overview of the main options available in the Rust ecosystem:

This short tutorial will focus on using RustCrypto to demonstrate practical examples of hashing, symmetric encryption, message authentication, and public-key cryptography, using Rust.


== RustCrypto

RustCrypto is a collection of cryptographic libraries written in the Rust programming language. 
It provides secure and efficient cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and tools for developers. 
The libraries within RustCrypto cover various cryptographic primitives such as hashing (e.g., SHA-256), encryption (e.g., AES), digital signatures, key exchange, etc.

*Examples of crates*:

* *aes*: AES encryption
* *sha2*: SHA-2 hashing
* *hmac*: HMAC authentication
* *chacha20poly1305*: AEAD encryption
* *digest*, *ed25519-dalek*, *curve25519-dalek*, and others

In the following I will present practical examples of how to use some of these primitives.


=== 1) Hash with SHA-256

Hashing is a one-way function that takes an input and produces a fixed-length output (hash). 
It is commonly used for checksums, password storage, and data integrity verification.

*Key properties of hashing*:

- A hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) computes a unique digest from the input.
- ven small changes to the input produce drastically different hashes (_the avalanche effect_).
- Hashing is deterministic: the same input always produces the same output.
- Hashes are useful for integrity checks, password storage (with salt), and digital signatures.

*Rust coding example*:

See link:src/hashing.rs#29[src/hashing.rs] for a simple example demonstrating how to hash data using the `sha2` crate from RustCrypto.

=== 2) Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) and Password Hashing

Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) are used to securely derive cryptographic keys from passwords. Unlike basic hashing, KDFs are intentionally slow and memory-intensive, making brute-force attacks significantly more difficult.

==== Differences Between SHA-256 and Argon2

Why use a KDF instead of a simple hash like SHA-256?

|===

Argon2 is the recommended algorithm for password hashing, offering strong resistance to GPU-based attacks through its configurable time and memory costs.

*Rust coding example*:
See link:src/password_hashing_with_key_derivation_functions.rs#45[src/password_hashing_with_key_derivation_functions.rs] for an example of how to securely hash passwords using the argon2 crate from RustCrypto.

endif::[]



=== 3) Message Authentication Using HMAC

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is used to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message by combining a cryptographic hash function with a secret shared key.

*How it works*:

- Both the sender and receiver share a secret key.
- The sender generates an HMAC from the message using this shared key.
- The message and its HMAC are sent to the receiver.
- The receiver uses the same shared key to compute a new HMAC from the received message.
- If the newly computed HMAC matches the received one, the message is verified.

This ensures that the message has not been tampered with (integrity) and that it came from someone who knows the secret key (authenticity).

link:src/message_authentication.rs[This example] shows how we can use RustCrypto to generate and verify a `HMAC`.

*Rust coding example*:

See link:src/message_authentication.rs#64[src/message_authentication.rs] for an example using the `hmac` crate from RustCrypto to generate and verify HMACs.

=== 4) Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. It is commonly used for encrypting data at rest or in transit when both parties can securely share a secret key.

Modern symmetric encryption schemes often include authenticated encryption, which ensures both confidentiality (the data is hidden) and integrity/authenticity (the data has not been tampered with).

==== 4.1) Encryption & authentication with AES-256-GCM

*AES-256-GCM* is an authenticated encryption algorithm that combines the AES block cipher with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). It ensures:

- Confidentiality: The message is encrypted using AES-256.
- Integrity & Authenticity: A tag is generated to detect tampering, using the GCM mode.

*Key properties*:

- Requires a 256-bit secret key.
- Uses a unique nonce (number used once) for each encryption operation.
- Produces a ciphertext and an authentication tag.
- Decryption fails if the ciphertext or tag has been altered.

*Rust coding example*:

See link:src/symmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs#14[[src/symmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs] for an example of using the `aes-gcm` crate from RustCrypto to securely encrypt and authenticate a message with `AES-256-GCM`.

==== 4.2) Encryption & authentication with ChaCha20-Poly1305

*ChaCha20-Poly1305* is another modern authenticated encryption algorithm that provides both confidentiality and authenticity. Unlike AES, which is based on block ciphers, ChaCha20 is a stream cipher. It‚Äôs designed to be highly secure and efficient, particularly in environments where hardware acceleration for AES may not be available.

*Key properties*:

- ChaCha20 provides the encryption (confidentiality) with a stream cipher.
- Poly1305 provides the message authentication code (MAC), ensuring integrity and authenticity.
- Requires a 256-bit secret key and a unique nonce for each encryption.
- Ideal for environments with limited resources (e.g., mobile devices, IoT) due to its simplicity and performance.

This combination is considered secure, and it is used in protocols like `TLS 1.3` and modern VPN technologies.

*Rust coding example*:

See link:src/symmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs#63[src/symmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs] for an example of using the `chacha20poly1305` crate from RustCrypto to perform authenticated encryption with `ChaCha20-Poly1305`.

=== 5) Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys: a *public key* (for encryption) and a *private key* (for decryption). This is ideal for scenarios where secure key distribution is important, as the public key can be shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.

==== 5.1)  Asymmetric Encryption for Confidentiality Using RSA and OAEP

*RSA* is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms. 
When combined with *OAEP* (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding), it offers both confidentiality and protection against certain types of attacks, such as chosen-ciphertext attacks.

NOTE: *Chosen-ciphertext attacks* (CCA) are a type of cryptographic attack where an attacker can submit ciphertexts of their choice to be decrypted and then observe the resulting plaintexts. By doing this, the attacker tries to gain information that helps them decrypt other ciphertexts or even recover the decryption key. Simple encryption schemes like RSA without padding are not CCA-secure‚Äîattackers can manipulate ciphertexts to learn information. Secure padding schemes like OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) or using authenticated encryption (like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305) help defend against CCAs.

*Key properties*:

- RSA is used for encryption and decryption.
- OAEP adds padding to the message before encryption, making it more secure.
- RSA with OAEP is often used for encrypting small pieces of data (e.g., symmetric keys in hybrid encryption systems).


*Rust coding example*:
Check the code at link:src/asymmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs#15[src/asymmetric_encryption_rsa_oaep.rs]. The example demonstrates how to use `RSA` with `OAEP` for encryption and decryption using RustCrypto.

==== 5.2) Asymmetric encryption for Digital Signatures using RSA and PKCS1-v1_5

*Digital signatures* are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. Using *RSA* and *PKCS1-v1_5* padding, a private key signs the data, and the public key can be used to verify the signature.

*Key properties*:

- *RSA* is used to sign data with the private key and verify the signature with the public key.
- *PKCS1-v1_5* padding is used for both signing and verification to enhance security.
- Digital signatures are widely used in software distribution, secure communications, and authentication systems.

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to sign and verify messages using `RSA` and `PKCS1-v1_5` with RustCrypto. Check it out in the code at link:src/asymmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs#41[src/asymmetric_encryption_rsa_pkcs1_v15.rs].

==== 5.3) Asymmetric Encryption for Digital Signatures using Ed25519

*Ed25519* is a modern elliptic-curve signature scheme known for its high security and performance. It is widely used for applications that require efficient and secure digital signatures.

*Key properties*:

- *Ed25519* offers strong security based on elliptic curve cryptography.
- It provides fast and efficient signing and verification operations.
- Digital signatures with *Ed25519* are commonly used in modern protocols, such as *SSH*, *TLS*, and cryptocurrency systems.

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to use `Ed25519` (elliptic-curve) for digital signatures with RustCrypto. Check it out in the code at link:src/asymmetric_authenticated_encryption_example.rs#85[src/asymmetric_encryption_ed25519.rs].

=== 6) Key exchange

Key exchange algorithms allow two parties to securely share a secret key over an insecure channel. These algorithms ensure that even if an attacker intercepts the exchanged data, they cannot derive the secret key.

==== 6.1) Key exchange using Diffie-Hellman (DH) 

The *Diffie-Hellman* (DH) key exchange protocol allows two parties to generate a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. *DH* is based on modular arithmetic and is commonly used for secure communication protocols.

*Key properties*:

- Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to independently generate a shared secret key.
- The security of DH relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.
- This method can be used for both symmetric key encryption and secure communication.

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to perform a key exchange using the traditional `Diffie-Hellman` (DH) algorithm with RustCrypto. Check it out in the code at link:src/key_exchange.rs#29[src/key_exchange.rs].

.Code Snippet
[source,rust,linenums]
include::src/key_exchange.rs[lines=29..57]


==== 6.2) Key exchange using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH): Public Keys without Serialization

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is a more efficient version of Diffie-Hellman that uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for key exchange. In this case, public keys are exchanged without serialization, allowing for faster processing

*Key properties*:

- *ECDH* uses elliptic curve mathematics to achieve faster and more secure key exchanges than traditional *DH*.
- No serialization of the public keys means a more compact and efficient exchange.
- It is ideal for environments where performance and smaller key sizes are important (e.g., mobile devices, IoT).

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to perform an `ECDH` key exchange using raw public keys without serialization. Check it out in the code at link:src/key_exchange.rs#72[src/key_exchange.rs].

.Code Snippet
[source,rust,linenums]
include::src/key_exchange.rs[lines=66..87]


==== 6.3) Key exchange using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH): Public Keys serialized into Byte Arrays (EncodedPoint)

This variation of *ECDH* involves serializing the public keys into byte arrays (using the EncodedPoint format) before performing the key exchange. Serialization allows for easier transmission of keys over networks.

*Key properties*:

- Public keys are serialized into a standardized format, ensuring interoperability with different systems.
- The serialization format (EncodedPoint) provides a compact and secure representation of elliptic curve points.
- This is the preferred method for many modern systems that require key exchange over untrusted networks.

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to perform an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (`ECDH`) key exchange with public keys serialized into byte arrays (`EncodedPoint`). Check it out in the code at link:src/key_exchange.rs#90[src/key_exchange.rs].

.Code Snippet
[source,rust,linenums]
include::src/key_exchange.rs[lines=90..115]


==== 6.4) Key exchange using X25519 Key Exchange algorithm


*X25519* is a specific elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) variant that is optimized for performance and security. It is designed to be more efficient and secure than traditional ECDH, and it is commonly used in modern protocols such as *TLS 1.3* and VPNs.

*Key properties*:

- *X25519* is an elliptic curve used specifically for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, offering strong security and high performance.
- It is resistant to common attacks such as _side-channel attacks_ and provides fast key exchange.
- *X25519* is designed for use in modern cryptographic systems requiring both high security and performance.

*Rust coding example*:
This example demonstrates how to perform key exchange using the `X25519` algorithm with RustCrypto. Check it out in the code at link:src/key_exchange.rs#138[src/key_exchange.rs].
